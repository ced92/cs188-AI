[CS188 course] (http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) at UC Berkely
#Intro to Artificial Intelligence
The purpose of this repository is to showcase projects I have been working on. Due to the honor code we are not allowed to post full code solutions to the problems and as such I will ***only*** present strategies and small demos.

I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications. Particularly, the course does a very good job of tying together several related areas. For a full description please visit the [website] (http://ai.berkeley.edu/course_policies.html).
